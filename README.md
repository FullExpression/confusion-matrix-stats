# Confusion Matrix Statistics Calculations

[![production-build](https://github.com/FullExpression/confusion-matrix-stats/actions/workflows/production-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FullExpression/confusion-matrix-stats/actions/workflows/production-build.yml)

As the name suggests, this library aims to facilitate the calculations of several **metrics** using a **multi-dimensional confusion matrix**.

Provides a set of feature, not only to obtain matrix such as [accuracy](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#accuracy), [precision](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#precision) and [f1Score](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#f1score), but also [matrix normalization](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#normalize), [cloning](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#clone), [numberOfPredictions](https://confusion-matrix-stats-doc.web.app/classes/confusionmatrix.html#getnumberofpredictions), etc.

*This library was inspired on [scikit-learn confusion-matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html) written for python. Our goal is to create the same concept for the javascript world.*

## üõ†Ô∏è How to install

Run the following command:

`npm install confusion-matrix-stats`

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to use it

You just need to create a new `Confusion Matrix` instance:

``` typescript
const confusionMatrix = new ConfusionMatrix({
    labels: ["Happiness", "Sadness", "Disgust"], 
    matrix: [[50, 2, 3],
             [8, 50 ,5],
             [2, 5 ,50]]
});
```

And then, call the function to obtain the desired metric:

``` typescript
// Calculates the accuracy value for the all matrix.
const accuracy = confusionMatrix.accuracy();
```

For each metric calculation, is possible to define a different configurations in order to fine tune the calculation formula:

``` typescript
// Calculates the f1Score, only for "sadness" class, using the Macro average method.
const labelAccuracy = confusionMatrix.f1Score({ label: "Sadness", average: AverageMethod.Macro});
```
